## Axat Bhardwaj
**Blockchain and Backend Developer**

I am a seasoned Blockchain and Backend Developer with a deep passion for building robust, scalable systems on EVM-compatible networks. My journey has taken me from optimizing smart contracts to save thousands in gas fees, to leading teams in deploying cutting-edge Layer 2 and Layer 3 rollups.

With extensive experience in Solidity, Python, and a variety of backend frameworks, I've had the privilege of designing foundational blockchain infrastructure for enterprise clients, developing custom token standards, and even engineering AI agents to interact with the crypto ecosystem. I'm driven by the challenges of scaling Web3 and creating efficient, decentralized solutions.

When I'm not architecting the future of the decentralized web, you can find me unwinding by:
- Strumming my guitar
- Diving into video games
- Playing a few rounds of badminton
- Pondering life through philosophy books

I'm always excited to connect and discuss new ideas in the Web3 space. Let's build something amazing together.
