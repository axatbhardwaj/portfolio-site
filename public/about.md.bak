## Axat Bhardwaj
**Blockchain and Backend Developer**

I am a passionate Blockchain and Backend Developer with a deep love for everything EVM-compatible. From architecting robust smart contracts to diving deep into the mechanics of Layer 2 rollups, I thrive on building scalable and efficient decentralized systems. I consider myself a Layer 2 whiz, always excited by the challenge of optimizing and scaling blockchain solutions.

My journey through the blockchain space has seen me lead teams in deploying L3 rollups, engineer complex smart contracts for DeFi applications, and even build AI agents that interact with the crypto world. I'm driven by the constant innovation in the Web3 ecosystem and am always eager to tackle the next big challenge.

When I'm not writing code or architecting systems, you can find me:
- Strumming my guitar
- Exploring virtual worlds in video games
- Playing a competitive game of badminton
- Getting lost in a good philosophy book

I believe in building the future, one block at a time.
